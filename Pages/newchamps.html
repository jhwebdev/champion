					<h2>New Quests:</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Infinity Nightmare</br>- Thanos has won. His Infinity Gauntlet is complete, and with it he wields supreme power. Sitting atop The Battlerealm, he issues his first decree: “NO MORE GAMES. THE CONTEST OF CHAMPIONS IS OVER”. Everything grinds to a halt. His children hunt the heroes, who have taken refuge in the Astral Plane. It’s up to an uneasy alliance between M.O.D.O.K., Mephisto, and an army of freed Champions, led by Captain America and Iron Man to stop Thanos, or die trying. Help them defeat Thanos now in our new event quest beginning on May 2nd</li>
					</ul>
