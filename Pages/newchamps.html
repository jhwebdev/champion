					<h2>New Quests:</h2>
					<ul>
						<dl>
						<dt><u>Infinity Nightmare</u></dt>
						<dd>- Thanos has won. His Infinity Gauntlet is complete, and with it he wields supreme power. Sitting atop The Battlerealm, he issues his first decree: “NO MORE GAMES. THE CONTEST OF CHAMPIONS IS OVER”. Everything grinds to a halt. His children hunt the heroes, who have taken refuge in the Astral Plane. It’s up to an uneasy alliance between M.O.D.O.K., Mephisto, and an army of freed Champions, led by Captain America and Iron Man to stop Thanos, or die trying.</dd>
						</dl>
						<dt><dt>Infinity Dungeons</dt>
						<dd>- Team up with another Summoner to battle through an endless series of Rooms. Even better, they don’t have to be in your alliance! Strategize with them while in the Dungeon with the new Quick Chat feature. Each Dungeon has a unique theme depending on the day you play, including randomized Buffs on Nodes that are different every time you play.</dd>
						<dd>The further you go, the harder it becomes, and the better the rewards. Once you have completed a Room, you must decide whether to push on to the next and more difficult Room, or conclude the Dungeon and collect the points and rewards you’ve earned so far. Points earn you a new currency called Dark Artifacts. Use these vessels of dark power to purchase new Infinity Dungeon Crystals containing Champions. Recruit a friend and see how far you can get!</dd>
